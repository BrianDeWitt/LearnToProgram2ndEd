# Learn To Program, 2nd Edition
All of my code from the A Few Things to Try and other exercises in the PragProg book Learn to Program, 2nd Edition.

## How This Repository Works
I have created folders for each chapter of the book. I did not begin saving the code that I wrote as I worked through the book until Chapter 6 (called chap06 in the file names).

### Naming Convention
I named each source code file with the abbreviation 'chap', followed by the two digit number of the chapter (ex. 17, 05 or 11), an underscore (_) and then the number of the exercise. 

*NOTE* the number of the exercise may not correspond with any numbering in the book. It is just the order in which I tackled the example, exercise or tangent in that chapter. Put another way, it is the order in which I typed, ran and saved some code.
